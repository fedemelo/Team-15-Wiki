# Team-15-Wiki
This is the central repository for **Team 15: UniTrade**.

This repository was created for the Mobile Application Development class for the 2024-20 semester.<br/>
See also: [Why did we choose a repo instead of an organization?](https://github.com/fedemelo/Team-15-Wiki/wiki/Why-Did-We-Choose-a-Repository-Instead-of-an-Organization%3F)

All documentation and deliverables related to the class can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/fedemelo/Team-15-Wiki/wiki).

This repository also serves as a way to easily access the development repository for each subteam:
1. [Team 15 - Swifties (Swift)](https://github.com/fedemelo/team-15-swifties)
2. [Team 15 - 404 Name Not Found (Flutter)](https://github.com/fedemelo/Team-15-404NameNotFound)

Additionally, we use a [Kanban board](https://github.com/users/fedemelo/projects/5) to track the progress of all team activities, including deliverables and the development of the Swift and Flutter applications.
