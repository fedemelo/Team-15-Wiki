# Team-15-Wiki
This repository is the central knowledge base for Team 15, containing all documentation and deliverables related to the class within its [Wiki](https://github.com/fedemelo/Team-15-Wiki/wiki).

It also serves as a way to easily access the Team's repos:
1. [Team 15 - Swifties](https://github.com/fedemelo/team-15-swifties)
2. [Team 15 - Flutter](https://github.com/ernestocpc/Team-15-404NameNotFound)

In addition to documentation, we use a [Kanban board](https://github.com/users/fedemelo/projects/5) to manage and track the progress of all team activities, including deliverables and the development of both Swift and Flutter applications.
